Eros was launched in 2012. The nose behind this fragrance is Aurelien Guichard. Top notes are Mint, Green Apple and Lemon; middle notes are Tonka Bean, Ambroxan and Geranium; base notes are Madagascar Vanilla, Virginian Cedar, Atlas Cedar, Vetiver and Oakmoss. Versace is launching a new fragrance for men \u2013 Eros inspired by and deeply connected with Greek mythology. The aim of this edition is to reveal and release unrestrained passion and to accentuate desire. The fragrance was named after Greek god of love and son of goddess Aphrodite \u2013 Eros. Inspiration by ancient Greece has lasted since the time when Gianni Versace raised his fashion empire and took goddess Medusa as symbol of the brand to adorn numerous products of the house, among them also the new flacon of men's fragrance Eros. The new perfume Eros is the first in the past five years to be launched and aimed at men. Donatella Versace's desire was to fit the fragrance into the concept of the Versace brand and to depict style and significance of long-lasting design, quality and popularity. \"Eros is truly the DNA of the house of Versace\" - explains Donatella. \"We have a Greek motive making us think about ancient Greece, antiquities and mythology, while turquoise color represents the Mediterranean. That is Versace!\" Eros was created by Aurelien Guichard of Givaudan and it was announced as fresh, woody and slightly oriental. The fragrance includes mint oil combined with green apple and Italian lemon. Warmth is provided by tonka mixed with Venezuelan ambroxan and geranium flowers giving a fougere twist to the fragrance this way. Flacon of the new fragrance for men Eros is created of turquoise color glass with head of Medusa on the body of the bottle and on its top. The fragrance is available as 50 and 100 ml EDT, along with accompanying perfumed body care products. Face of the advertising campaign is Brian Shimansky, while photographers are Mert & Marcus. Donatella wanted a man-gladiator for the new campaign, who is fighting for what he wants, fighting for his goals. \"This is a fragrance for a man who is his own master. He is a hero: a man who defends their ideas and goals.\" - stated Donatella Versace.\u00a0 Read about this perfume in other languages: Deutsch, Espa\u00f1ol, Fran\u00e7ais, Italiano, \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439, Polski, Portugu\u00eas, \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac, \u6c49\u8bed, Nederlands, Srpski, Rom\u00e2n\u0103, \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629, \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430, \u041c\u043e\u043d\u0433\u043e\u043b, \u05e2\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05ea.", "top notes": ["Mint", "Green Apple", "Lemon"], "middle notes": ["Tonka Bean", "Ambroxan", "Geranium"], "base notes": ["Madagascar Vanilla", "Virginian Cedar", "Atlas Cedar", "Vetiver", "Oakmoss"], "longevity": {"very weak": 125, "weak": 167, "moderate": 818, "long lasting": 2248, "eternal": 770}, "sillage": {"intimate": 353, "moderate": 1267, "strong": 2317, "enormous": 614}, "gender_vote": {"female": 6, "more female": 7, "unisex": 72, "more male": 248, "male": 354}, "price value": {"way overpriced": 13, "overpriced": 47, "ok": 265, "good value": 254, "great value": 52}}, {"name": "Good Girl", "company": "Carolina Herrera", "image": "https://fimgs.net/mdimg/perfume/375x500.39681.jpg", "for_gender": "for women", "rating": 3.77, "number_votes": 6731, "main accords": {"white floral": 100.0, "warm spicy": 95.3296, "sweet": 94.2315, "vanilla": 87.921, "cacao": 75.3138, "tuberose": 67.4603, "amber": 66.946, "almond": 61.0663, "woody": 60.3574, "powdery": 55.6957}, "description": "Good Girl by Carolina Herrera is a Oriental Floral fragrance for women.

The new perfume is inspired by the hedonistic lifestyle of Loris Azzaro during the 1970s.\u00a0 \"Azzaro Wanted by Night is the fragrance of a modern-day seducer. An extraordinary man. Elegant, bold, mysterious, he is surrounded by an air of confidence and power. Whether night or day, he attracts and arouses desire\u2026 For him, it\u2019s an endless night; and for them, it\u2019s a one-on-one moment that they will never forget...\" Azzaro Wanted by Night is announced as an explosive woody and spicy oriental of unabashed sensuality, a \"blend of temptation and masculinity.\" The composition mixes exotic woods and spices, and highlights the three main accords: cinnamon, red cedar and tobacco. The face of the advertising campaign is model Nikola\u00ef Danielsen. The cylindrical Azzaro Wanted bottle is transformed with chrome-plated cap with an elegant dark smoky lacquer, to contrast the amber fragrance within. The fragrance is available as a 50 and 100 ml Eau de Parfum.
