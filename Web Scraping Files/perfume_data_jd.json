According to the legend, twenty- year-old Prince Khurram met a young girl, named Arjumand Banu at the bazaar where her family worked. Mesmerized by her beauty, after becoming emperor, he made her his wife as Mumtaz Mahal, meaning the \"Jewel of the Palace\". After the wedding, the prince and Mumtaz were inseparable, in war and in peace. She had given 13 children to Shahjahan and died during the birth of their 14th child at the age of 39. Her death devastated Shah Jahan and had built Taj Mahal in memory of his wife and their undying love. Shalimar is named after \u2018The Gardens of Shalimar\u2019.It was Mumtaz\u2019s favorite garden. Shalimar is one of the best selling perfumes ever and its magic is undeniable. Perfume is composed of citrus notes; lemon and bergamot, jasmine, may rose, opoponax, Tonka bean, vanilla, iris, Peru balsam and gray amber. The coolness of the citrus notes lead to a floral heart ending with a warm and luxurious trail.

Top notes are Mint, Green Apple and Lemon; middle notes are Tonka Bean, Ambroxan and Geranium; base notes are Madagascar Vanilla, Virginian Cedar, Atlas Cedar, Vetiver and Oakmoss. Versace is launching a new fragrance for men \u2013 Eros inspired by and deeply connected with Greek mythology. The aim of this edition is to reveal and release unrestrained passion and to accentuate desire. The fragrance was named after Greek god of love and son of goddess Aphrodite \u2013 Eros. Inspiration by ancient Greece has lasted since the time when Gianni Versace raised his fashion empire and took goddess Medusa as symbol of the brand to adorn numerous products of the house, among them also the new flacon of men's fragrance Eros. The new perfume Eros is the first in the past five years to be launched and aimed at men. Donatella Versace's desire was to fit the fragrance into the concept of the Versace brand and to depict style and significance of long-lasting design, quality and popularity. \"Eros is truly the DNA of the house of Versace\" - explains Donatella. \"We have a Greek motive making us think about ancient Greece, antiquities and mythology, while turquoise color represents the Mediterranean. That is Versace!\" Eros was created by Aurelien Guichard of Givaudan and it was announced as fresh, woody and slightly oriental. The fragrance includes mint oil combined with green apple and Italian lemon. Warmth is provided by tonka mixed with Venezuelan ambroxan and geranium flowers giving a fougere twist to the fragrance this way. Flacon of the new fragrance for men Eros is created of turquoise color glass with head of Medusa on the body of the bottle and on its top. The fragrance is available as 50 and 100 ml EDT, along with accompanying perfumed body care products. Face of the advertising campaign is Brian Shimansky, while photographers are Mert & Marcus. Donatella wanted a man-gladiator for the new campaign, who is fighting for what he wants, fighting for his goals. \"This is a fragrance for a man who is his own master. He is a hero: a man who defends their ideas and goals.\" - stated Donatella Versace.\u00a0 Read about this perfume in other languages: Deutsch, Espa\u00f1ol, Fran\u00e7ais, Italiano, \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439, Polski, Portugu\u00eas, \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac, \u6c49\u8bed, Nederlands, Srpski, Rom\u00e2n\u0103, \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629, \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430, \u041c\u043e\u043d\u0433\u043e\u043b, \u05e2\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05ea.", "top notes": ["Mint", "Green Apple", "Lemon"], "middle notes": ["Tonka Bean", "Ambroxan", "Geranium"], "base notes": ["Madagascar Vanilla", "Virginian Cedar", "Atlas Cedar", "Vetiver", "Oakmoss"], "longevity": {"very weak": 125, "weak": 167, "moderate": 818, "long lasting": 2248, "eternal": 770}, "sillage": {"intimate": 353, "moderate": 1267, "strong": 2317, "enormous": 614}, "gender_vote": {"female": 6, "more female": 7, "unisex": 72, "more male": 248, "male": 354}, "price value": {"way overpriced": 13, "overpriced": 47, "ok": 265, "good value": 254, "great value": 52}}, {"name": "Good Girl", "company": "Carolina Herrera", "image": "https://fimgs.net/mdimg/perfume/375x500.39681.jpg", "for_gender": "for women", "rating": 3.77, "number_votes": 6731, "main accords": {"white floral": 100.0, "warm spicy": 95.3296, "sweet": 94.2315, "vanilla": 87.921, "cacao": 75.3138, "tuberose": 67.4603, "amber": 66.946, "almond": 61.0663, "woody": 60.3574, "powdery": 55.6957}, "description": "Good Girl by Carolina Herrera is a Oriental Floral fragrance for women.

The smell of autumn, forest, odor of great and dark woods... Bois des Iles, or the Island Forests, was created in 1926 by Ernest Beaux, the Russian emigrant and the prime perfumer of the Chanel house. It is said that Beaux created Bois des Iles while he was rapt by Tchaikovsky\\'s Queen of Spades, the opera inspired by the Puskin\\'s novel about the love and hazard, and that it was his favorite creation.\nTraditional masculine woody composition is offered to ladies, but could be tried by men as well. Dry and spicy freshness leads to the floral heart, the light sweetness of which undulates with dry and dark woody notes. At the end, the composition becomes warmer, more comfortable and tame, as if entering into a dark room illuminated by the fireplace flame.\nThe perfume concentration is richer and sweeter, while eau de toilette is quite lighter, but magnificent. The top notes are composed of aldehydes, bergamot, neroli and peach, the heart composition consists of jasmine, rose, lily of the valley, woody iris and ylang-ylang, and the base of vetiver, sandalwood, benzoin and musk.

Since she had been involved into music she chose name \u201cArpege\u201d, i.e. music term arpeggio. The original 1927 formula incredibly corresponded to its musical term - the notes of perfume play their theme alternately. In 1993, the perfume was reconstructed and that was a successful work. The composition was mostly well preserved, but still that was second great perfume. Top notes are: bergamot, aldehide, peach, orange bloom, honeysuckle, orris.

Alien is a magic elixir captured in a bottle of deep and mysterious purple\u00a0with\u00a0the shape of a talisman, reminiscent of a philosopher's\u00a0stone or some warlock object. The creators of Alien based the composition on three main lines: warm, white amber in the base, woodsy notes in the heart, and sunny Indian jasmine in the top.
