Narciso Rodriguez For Her was launched in 2003. Narciso Rodriguez For Her was created by Christine Nagel and Francis Kurkdjian. Top notes are African Orange flower, Osmanthus and Bergamot; middle notes are Musk and Amber; base notes are Vetiver, Vanille and Patchouli. This perfume is the winner of 2 awards: FiFi Award Fragrance Of The Year Women`s Nouveau Niche 2004 and FiFi Award Fragrance Of The Year Women`s Nouveau Niche 2007.Young and very modern American designer of Cuban origins Narciso Rodriguez has launched his first fragrances which has instantly become the hit in the US, and not only there. The new modern aroma is aimed at the modern and free woman, who is aware of her sexuality. Popularity of this fragrance (regardless of its unusual composition and a heavy character, and perhaps exactly because of that) is easy to explain because it reflects a desire of every woman to attract and seduce, and this fragrance has openly sexual character. Unusual lustful composition is created with the sensual musk in its centre, surrounded by orange, osmanthus and amber. The base unites vanilla, amber and vetiver. Intensive sharp scent with hidden and scarcely discernible densely-sweet nuance in the centre later turns into a soft and balmy powder. The aggression disappears and the fragrance becomes tame and gentle.\nAt first, in 2004 it was launched as EDT in a black bottle in pink outer box. Then in 2006 the EDP was created in a pink bottle and black outer box. The composition was changed, despite the fact that the musk note has remained in the centre of the composition. EDP has rose note in the top. The trace has become more mysterious and rich, thanks to exotic woods \u2013 patchouli and sandalwood. Both variances of the fragrance can be described as floral chypre with intensive musk nuance, only the first one is sharper and more aggressive, while the second one is sweeter and softer. The creators of these fragrances are Christine Nagel and Francis Kurkdjian.

The green sharpness of ripe mango and the spicy warmth of pink pepper make an impressive prelude to the mysterious heart of aromatic frankincense and papyrus smoke.

This wild, magical, and mysterious African fragrance with woodsy notes, thick resins and spices, lasts on skin for a long time.

The fragrance features passionflower, which creates both a gentle and a passionate feminine aura; the\u00a0magical product of orchid--vanilla-smells warm and creamy on skin; and vetiver surrounded with white flowers and jasmine Sambac gives a sensual and deep sensation. The beautiful bottle is designed in the\u00a0form of a woman\u2019s silhouette, and the color of the perfume hypnotizes just like the\u00a0tender blue of a woman\u2019s eyes. See Hypnose video ad.

Carnal Flower was launched in 2005. The nose behind this fragrance is Dominique Ropion. Carnal Flower or forbidden flower is a fragrance with the scent of tuberose. Tuberose is a beautiful and dangerous flower. In some cultures, it is not allowed for young women to feel its intoxicating scent after sunset. Tuberose is a symbol of forbidden pleasure, hiding its passionate, sensual character behind its fresh, white, floral face. Its intoxicating scent seduces many perfumers; Frederic Malle and creator Dominique Ropion tried to repeat this scent in their particular way. Frederic Malle was inspired for Carnal Flower during his visits to California, where everything smells like gardenia and tuberose. Dominique Ropion worked on development of the formula for more than two years. The perfume contains a larger dose of tuberose absolute than any other perfume. The composition opens with heavy, green notes of citrus leaves and branches. As tuberose develops, the green nuance passes into a note of camphora, which softens the opulent flowers unintrusively. Fruity nuances of melon and coconut add light and slightly gourmet sound to the composition and do not attract attention. The muse for this perfume was Frederic Malle\u2019s aunt, famous actress Candice Bergen, who acted in the movie Carnal Knowledge with Jack Nicholson. The top notes contain: bergamot, melon and eucalyptus.\nThe middle notes include: ylang-ylang, jasmine, tuberose, Salicylates (natural, toxic product of herbal origin, a sort of a herbal feromone which is used by plants as a warning).\nThe base encompasses: tuberose absolute, orange blossom absolute, coconut and musk. The perfume was created in 2005.

This perfume is the winner of award FiFi Award Best National Advertising Campaign / TV 2006.Lovely is the first fragrance by Sarah Jessica Parker (in partnership with Coty Inc.). Obsessed with style and fashion, Sarah always wanted to create a signature scent that would be very sexy and yet undeniably classy. Lovely \"pays homage to her mother and the art of perfumery.\"\u00a0She did not want her fragrance to be overpowering, but instantly recognizable, like the aromatic concoction she made for herself from three\u00a0separate fragrances before she co-created Lovely. Lovely is a soft, powdery, discreet,\u00a0and very intimate fragrance, announced as a \"silky white amber fragrance.\"\u00a0It possesses an elegance characteristic of classic fragrances, and yet the fragrance is quite modern and very charming. It opens with soft citruses and woody (rosewood) notes, with a touch of lavender, which is not at all sharp. The fragrance develops further with notes of apple martini, paperwhites (narcissus),\u00a0and orchid. The base unites white amber, cedar, woody note,s and white musk. According to Sarah, the perfume is appropriate for all generations: \"from 17 to 107.\"\u00a0The fragrance was created by Laurent Le Guernec and Clement Gavarry in 2005 with Sarah herself being the creative director, actively participating in the process from its start to finish.
