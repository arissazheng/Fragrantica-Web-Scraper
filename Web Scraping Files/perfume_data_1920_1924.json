Chanel N\u00b05 (Vintage) was launched in 1921. The nose behind this fragrance is Ernest Beaux. Top notes are Aldehydes, Ylang-Ylang, Neroli, Lemon and Bergamot; middle notes are Rose, iris, Jasmine, Orris Root and Lily-of-the-Valley; base notes are Civet, Sandalwood, Amber, Musk, Vanilla, Oakmoss, Patchouli and Vetiver. The famous Chanel N\u00b05 is a symbol of good taste and is currently one of the best selling perfumes in the world. Coco Chanel asked the perfume designer Ernest Beaux to create a perfume \u201cwhich smells like a woman\u201c. Chanel N\u00b05 is a very complex fragrance which does not allow any of the fragrant components to be isolated out of the composition, what was exactly a request of the great Chanel \u2013 the perfume should not smell like a rose, or a lily of the valley, but as a composition. The perfume became famous thanks to many celebrities who wore it, among which Marilyn Monroe. Chanel N\u00b05 is often connected to her name because during an interview in 1954 she said that in bed she wore only \u2018some drops of Chanel N\u00b05\\'. That statement became a superb advertising slogan and a reason for millions of women around the world to choose this perfume. Ernest Beaux created two series of perfume samples numbered 1-5 and 20-24 and asked Coco Chanel to choose one of them. Madame Chanel chose the sample no. 5 and thus the perfume got its name. Superstitious, Chanel presented her new perfume on the fifth day of the fifth month of 1921. Working on creation of this perfume, Ernest Beaux created and for the first time used the synthetic component \u2013 aldehydes. In his formula the aldehydes are accompanied by fragrances of rose and jasmine. The fragrance of aldehydes is pure and fresh, reminds of the odor of clean linen just brought in the house form the fresh frosty air. It is said that the famous creator drew his inspiration for creation of this fragrance from one of his visits to the Arctic Circle and the smell of water in midnight. The unique smell of frozen lakes and rivers fascinated him so much that he decided to replicate it in his creation. Chanel N\u00b05 is the first perfume in the floral-aldehyde group and the first by the quantity of aldehydes in its composition (another legend says that the Ernest Beaux\\'s assistant overdosed the aldehydes in the composition by mistake). The top notes are composed of aldehydes, bergamot, lemon, neroli and ylang-ylang, the heart of jasmine, rose, lily of the valley and iris, while the base is created of vetiver, sandalwood, vanilla, amber and patchouli. The first Chanel N\u00b05 was captured in a simple rectangular bottle with the top which resembled Place Vendome in Paris. The first bottle was designed by Chanel herself and represents her classical principle \u2013 less is more.

Cuir de Russie, or Russian leather was a theme modern at the end of the 19th century. Many perfume houses were creating perfumes for women who smoked cigarettes. Today exclusive, Chanel\\'s Cuir de Russie was created in 1924. The fragrance is provocative and shocking, and that exactly was its purpose, because it was created for a woman who dared to smoke cigarettes in public. It was a kind of encouragement and approval, because at that time a woman who smoked was a scandalous and inconceivable symbol of emancipation. \nThe composition starts with aldehydes moderated by mild nectar of classical trio \u2013 rose, jasmine and ylang-ylang. The ending comes as smoky, animalistic note of dark leather. The main notes are: orange blossom, bergamot, mandarin, sage, iris, jasmine, rose, ylang-ylang, cedarwood, vetiver, styrax, leather, amber and vanilla.
