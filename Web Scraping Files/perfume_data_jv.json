Top notes are Jasmine, Bulgarian Rose and Orange Blossom; middle note is Musk; base notes are Coumarin, Cedar, Vetiver and Patchouli. With Narciso Eau de Parfum (2014), Narciso Rodriguez continued with its musky scented creations in minimalistic bottles that began with the debut fragrance Narciso Rodriguez For Her (2003). In June, 2015, Narciso Eau de Toilette was presented in a square, black bottle. The collection's new fragrance for early 2016 is housed in a bottle of delicate skin color that befits the name Narciso Poudr\u00e9e. This story of sensuality and seduction continues with a new chapter - velvety, powerful and delicate at the same time; warm and strong Narciso Poudr\u00e9e. The goal was to create a fragrant cloud that highlights a natural and mature femininity. Powdery musk dominates the heart of the perfume, which opens with a floral combination of Bulgarian rose and white jasmine. Woody notes of vetiver, black and white cedar end the composition. The face of the perfume is Raquel Zimmermann. Narciso Poudr\u00e9e is available as 30, 50 and 90 ml Eau de Parfum.
