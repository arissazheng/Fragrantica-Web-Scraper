Joy was launched in 1930. The nose behind this fragrance is Henri Almeras. Top notes are Bulgarian Rose, Ylang-Ylang and Tuberose; middle notes are Jasmine and May Rose; base notes are Musk and Sandalwood. JOY was created with a lot of care, just like the most expensive Haute-Cotture dress, and thus it was extraordinary and timeless. It was presented by Jean Patou as \\'the world\\'s most expensive perfume\\' right at the time of The Great Depression in 1929, when the market of luxury fashion crushed and Jean Patou\\'s house could survive only through the perfumes. JOY is created of rare flowers in unique concentration of 10600 flowers of jasmine and 28 dozens of roses which adorn the exceptional heart of this perfume. With the time JOY attains enormous success and became the second best selling perfume of all times (the first best-selling is the legendary Chanel N\u00b05). Intense and luscious with alluring floral composition, JOY was created by Henri Alm\u00e9ras, who made its top notes irresistibly delightful. The composition starts with fragrant jilt tuberose, luscious rose, ylang-ylang blossom, aldehydes, sweet and mouthwatering pear, and green notes. The heart beats passionately in pure and sweetly fresh jasmine notes, seductive and balmy spicy and darkened iris root. The base whiffs with sensual musk, warm and milky-powdery sandalwood, with mild musky civet tones. The bottle, of simple and straight lines with a golden thread around its neck, was designed by the architect Louis S\u00fce in 30ml, 50ml and 100ml sizes for Eau de Parfume and 30ml and 50ml sizes for Eau de Toilette. Regardelss of its simplicity, the bottle leaves an impression of luxury and hints that its content is one of the best perfumes of the world. In 1932 Jean Patou designed a small black and red bottle in which this perfume is also presented.

Mesmerized by her beauty, after becoming emperor, he made her his wife as Mumtaz Mahal, meaning the \"Jewel of the Palace\". After the wedding, the prince and Mumtaz were inseparable, in war and in peace. She had given 13 children to Shahjahan and died during the birth of their 14th child at the age of 39. Her death devastated Shah Jahan and had built Taj Mahal in memory of his wife and their undying love. Shalimar is named after \u2018The Gardens of Shalimar\u2019.It was Mumtaz\u2019s favorite garden. Shalimar is one of the best selling perfumes ever and its magic is undeniable. Perfume is composed of citrus notes; lemon and bergamot, jasmine, may rose, opoponax, Tonka bean, vanilla, iris, Peru balsam and gray amber. The coolness of the citrus notes lead to a floral heart ending with a warm and luxurious trail.

According to the legend, twenty- year-old Prince Khurram met a young girl, named Arjumand Banu at the bazaar where her family worked. Mesmerized by her beauty, after becoming emperor, he made her his wife as Mumtaz Mahal, meaning the \"Jewel of the Palace\". After the wedding, the prince and Mumtaz were inseparable, in war and in peace. She had given 13 children to Shahjahan and died during the birth of their 14th child at the age of 39. Her death devastated Shah Jahan and had built Taj Mahal in memory of his wife and their undying love. Shalimar is named after \u2018The Gardens of Shalimar\u2019.It was Mumtaz\u2019s favorite garden. Shalimar is one of the best selling perfumes ever and its magic is undeniable. Perfume is composed of citrus notes; lemon and bergamot, jasmine, may rose, opoponax, Tonka bean, vanilla, iris, Peru balsam and gray amber. The coolness of the citrus notes lead to a floral heart ending with a warm and luxurious trail.

According to the legend, twenty- year-old Prince Khurram met a young girl, named Arjumand Banu at the bazaar where her family worked. Mesmerized by her beauty, after becoming emperor, he made her his wife as Mumtaz Mahal, meaning the \"Jewel of the Palace\". After the wedding, the prince and Mumtaz were inseparable, in war and in peace. She had given 13 children to Shahjahan and died during the birth of their 14th child at the age of 39. Her death devastated Shah Jahan and had built Taj Mahal in memory of his wife and their undying love. Shalimar is named after \u2018The Gardens of Shalimar\u2019.It was Mumtaz\u2019s favorite garden. Shalimar is one of the best selling perfumes ever and its magic is undeniable. Perfume is composed of citrus notes; lemon and bergamot, jasmine, may rose, opoponax, Tonka bean, vanilla, iris, Peru balsam and gray amber. The coolness of the citrus notes lead to a floral heart ending with a warm and luxurious trail.

Eros was launched in 2012. The nose behind this fragrance is Aurelien Guichard. Top notes are Mint, Green Apple and Lemon; middle notes are Tonka Bean, Ambroxan and Geranium; base notes are Madagascar Vanilla, Virginian Cedar, Atlas Cedar, Vetiver and Oakmoss. Versace is launching a new fragrance for men \u2013 Eros inspired by and deeply connected with Greek mythology. The aim of this edition is to reveal and release unrestrained passion and to accentuate desire. The fragrance was named after Greek god of love and son of goddess Aphrodite \u2013 Eros. Inspiration by ancient Greece has lasted since the time when Gianni Versace raised his fashion empire and took goddess Medusa as symbol of the brand to adorn numerous products of the house, among them also the new flacon of men's fragrance Eros. The new perfume Eros is the first in the past five years to be launched and aimed at men. Donatella Versace's desire was to fit the fragrance into the concept of the Versace brand and to depict style and significance of long-lasting design, quality and popularity. \"Eros is truly the DNA of the house of Versace\" - explains Donatella. \"We have a Greek motive making us think about ancient Greece, antiquities and mythology, while turquoise color represents the Mediterranean. That is Versace!\" Eros was created by Aurelien Guichard of Givaudan and it was announced as fresh, woody and slightly oriental. The fragrance includes mint oil combined with green apple and Italian lemon. Warmth is provided by tonka mixed with Venezuelan ambroxan and geranium flowers giving a fougere twist to the fragrance this way. Flacon of the new fragrance for men Eros is created of turquoise color glass with head of Medusa on the body of the bottle and on its top. The fragrance is available as 50 and 100 ml EDT, along with accompanying perfumed body care products. Face of the advertising campaign is Brian Shimansky, while photographers are Mert & Marcus. Donatella wanted a man-gladiator for the new campaign, who is fighting for what he wants, fighting for his goals. \"This is a fragrance for a man who is his own master. He is a hero: a man who defends their ideas and goals.\" - stated Donatella Versace.\u00a0 Read about this perfume in other languages: Deutsch, Espa\u00f1ol, Fran\u00e7ais, Italiano, \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439, Polski, Portugu\u00eas, \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac, \u6c49\u8bed, Nederlands, Srpski, Rom\u00e2n\u0103, \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629, \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430, \u041c\u043e\u043d\u0433\u043e\u043b, \u05e2\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05ea.", "top notes": ["Mint", "Green Apple", "Lemon"], "middle notes": ["Tonka Bean", "Ambroxan", "Geranium"], "base notes": ["Madagascar Vanilla", "Virginian Cedar", "Atlas Cedar", "Vetiver", "Oakmoss"], "longevity": {"very weak": 125, "weak": 167, "moderate": 818, "long lasting": 2248, "eternal": 770}, "sillage": {"intimate": 353, "moderate": 1267, "strong": 2317, "enormous": 614}, "gender_vote": {"female": 6, "more female": 7, "unisex": 72, "more male": 248, "male": 354}, "price value": {"way overpriced": 13, "overpriced": 47, "ok": 265, "good value": 254, "great value": 52}}, {"name": "Baccarat Rouge 540", "company": "Maison Francis Kurkdjian", "image": "https://fimgs.net/mdimg/perfume/375x500.33519.jpg", "for_gender": "for women and men", "rating": 4.03, "number_votes": 6059, "main accords": {"woody": 100.0, "amber": 91.1274, "warm spicy": 66.6313, "fresh spicy": 49.1087, "aromatic": 48.1396, "fresh": 45.0155, "conifer": 45.014, "animalic": 44.4436}, "description": "Baccarat Rouge 540 by Maison Francis Kurkdjian is a Oriental Floral fragrance for women and men.
