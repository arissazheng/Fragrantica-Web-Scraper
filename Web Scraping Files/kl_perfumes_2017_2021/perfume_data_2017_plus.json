The new Dior Homme is created by Dior in-house perfumer Francois Demachy who wanted to redefine masculine sensuality. The fragrance is intensely woody, warm, and sensual. A virile accord of Atlas cedar and the warmth of cashmere wood are pampered with spicy aromas.\u00a0 \"This new Dior Homme has an unmistakably virile signature that does not prevent it from developing tender, sensual accents. It basically draws the portrait of a modern man.\" Fran\u00e7ois Demachy, Dior Perfumer-Creator According to the perfumer, this is a fragrance overdosed with carnal woody notes, and it represents a return to the basics: classic and simplicity. It is clear, clean, gentle, and woody but also slightly sweet, and wears like a second skin. The new bottle follows the architectural design of its predecessors, with a more prominent logo and perfume name on the plug. The face of the advertising campaign remains actor Robert Pattinson. Dior Homme is available as a 50 and 100 ml Eau de Toilette with the accompanying grooming line, now available in new packaging.

Arabie was inspired by eastern spice shops; it is an exquisitely warm spicy fragrance, dense and sweet from aromatic resins, temperamental, sunny, yet mysterious like East itself. Precious notes of cedar and sandal blend in with sweet notes of candied mandarin, dried fig and date. Nutmeg, cumin and clove at the heart pervade the composition with hot spicy notes. Aromatic bay-leaf, harsh and pleasant, joins the spices, dwelling in dense resin waves of Tonka, Siamese benzoina and myrrh. The final accord of labdanum joins aromatic opulence into a harmonic wholeness.

Top notes are Pear and Bergamot; middle notes are Tuberose, Orange Blossom and Jasmine Sambac; base notes are Patchouli, Vanilla, Ambroxan and Vetiver. Among the first perfume creations of the house of Givenchy stands the legendary scent of L'Interdit from 1957, dedicated to actress Audrey Hepburn as the most significant muse of this fashion designer.\u00a0 In 2018, its new, modern version called L'Interdit Givenchy comes out, developed by perfumers Dominique Ropion, Anne Flipo and Fanny Bal as a floral-woody composition. The perfume is built on the basis of contrast between a bouquet of white flowers (including jasmine, tuberose and orange blossom) and intense woody and earthy notes of patchouli and vetiver. The concept behind the creation is the \"thrill of the forbidden\" and the challenge of crossing the line. ACTIVE INGREDIENTS: \"A white floral exalted with a dark accord. The first resolutely underground flower.\nThe white notes - orange blossom, jasmin and tuberose - are interlaced with darker more mysterious notes of vetiver and patchouli.\nA generous intense brightness that isn\u2019t afraid of subversion.\nUnforgettable, intense, addictive and fearlessly elegant. The shocking side of chic.\" The bottle of thick glass pays homage to the original shape with a more modern outline with the 4 G logo added to the black ribbon that encircles the neck. The face of the new L'Interdit release is actress Rooney Mara. Givenchy L'Interdit is available in 35, 50 and 80 ml Eau de Parfum.\n\u00a0 Read about this perfume in other languages: Deutsch, Espa\u00f1ol, Fran\u00e7ais, Italiano, \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439, Polski, Portugu\u00eas, \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac, \u6c49\u8bed, Nederlands, Srpski, Rom\u00e2n\u0103, \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629, \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430, \u041c\u043e\u043d\u0433\u043e\u043b, \u05e2\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05ea.", "top notes": ["Pear", "Bergamot"], "middle notes": ["Tuberose", "Orange Blossom", "Jasmine Sambac"], "base notes": ["Patchouli", "Vanilla", "Ambroxan", "Vetiver"], "longevity": {"very weak": 94, "weak": 103, "moderate": 366, "long lasting": 640, "eternal": 386}, "sillage": {"intimate": 227, "moderate": 582, "strong": 912, "enormous": 587}, "gender_vote": {"female": 308, "more female": 32, "unisex": 21, "more male": 0, "male": 0}, "price value": {"way overpriced": 6, "overpriced": 68, "ok": 188, "good value": 40, "great value": 12}}, {"name": "Y Eau de Parfum", "company": "Yves Saint Laurent", "image": "https://fimgs.net/mdimg/perfume/375x500.50757.jpg", "for_gender": "for men", "rating": 4.18, "number_votes": 2485, "main accords": {"aromatic": 100.0, "woody": 79.5738, "fresh spicy": 73.4814, "amber": 72.0841, "warm spicy": 71.743, "fruity": 66.1307, "fresh": 61.2038, "herbal": 58.4126, "citrus": 57.4027, "green": 53.8797}, "description": "Y Eau de Parfum by Yves Saint Laurent is a Aromatic Fougere fragrance for men.

Unlike the 2008 Chlo\u00e9 Eau de Parfum pillar, created to present purity and naturalness, the new Nomade is here to evoke the bold, adventurous side of Chloe women. It was created from inspiration by freedom, surprises, desire for open spaces and empowerment. Givaudan perfumer Quentin Bisch created Nomade as a floral chypre composition, including notes of Mirabelle plum, freesia and oak moss. The aim was to make it less floral and more \"dirty\" than the Chlo\u00e9 Signature. Chlo\u00e9 Signature represents a modern take of the perfume classic - the reinterpretation of the rose, while the new composition deals with the theme of chypre. The shape of the bottle mimics one of the classic bags of the house - the Drew model. The face of the advertising campaign filmed by Fleur Fortun\u00e9 is actress Ariane Labed.

Versace Eros Flame, is a flanker to the original masculine Eros from 2012. While the pillar is an aromatic-foug\u00e8re, the new scent goes into a totally different direction with citrusy, spicy, woody, and ambery accords, described as \"cold and hot, sweet and spicy, light and shadow.\" The concept is based on an interpretation of passionate love, marketed as a fragrance for a \"strong, passionate, self-confident man who is deeply in touch with his emotions.\" Olivier Pescheux developed the composition as one of contrasts; the head notes are made to be vivacious and fresh with italian citruses, black pepper and rosemary. Pepperwood, geranium and rose facets are in the heart, before a warm base of woods, blended with tonka and vanilla.

The cut-out shapes of the puppets sometimes include translucent color or other types of detailing. Various effects can be achieved by moving both the puppets and the light source. A talented puppeteer can make the figures appear to walk, dance, fight, nod and laugh.\nKARAGOZ (meaning \u201cblack eye\u201d in Turkish) and HACIVAT (shortened in time from \"Hac\u0131 \u0130vaz\" meaning \"\u0130vaz the Pilgrim\"), ZENNE (the common name of the generally beautiful and flirty women featuring in various plays) are the lead characters of the traditional Turkish shadow play, popularized during the Ottoman period and then spread to most nation states that comprised the Ottoman Empire and most prominently in Turkey and Greece.\nThe creative directors Mert G\u00fczel and Murat Katran dreamed of bringing the legend of Karagoz & Hacivat into the today\u2019s world. Under the inspiration of their playful characters, the perfume trilogy has been created together with the perfumer Jorge Lee. Just like the theme of these shadow plays, the main objective of NISHANE was to emphasize the contrasting interaction of the people that we can see in every single culture.\nHACIVAT is a tribute to elegance, competence, and love of art.\nZENNE is a tribute to beauty, self-confidence, and flirtation.\nKARAGOZ is a tribute to wittiness, straightforwardness and sincerity\u201d \u2014 press release of the brand.

The cut-out shapes of the puppets sometimes include translucent color or other types of detailing. Various effects can be achieved by moving both the puppets and the light source. A talented puppeteer can make the figures appear to walk, dance, fight, nod and laugh.\nKARAGOZ (meaning \u201cblack eye\u201d in Turkish) and HACIVAT (shortened in time from \"Hac\u0131 \u0130vaz\" meaning \"\u0130vaz the Pilgrim\"), ZENNE (the common name of the generally beautiful and flirty women featuring in various plays) are the lead characters of the traditional Turkish shadow play, popularized during the Ottoman period and then spread to most nation states that comprised the Ottoman Empire and most prominently in Turkey and Greece.\nThe creative directors Mert G\u00fczel and Murat Katran dreamed of bringing the legend of Karagoz & Hacivat into the today\u2019s world. Under the inspiration of their playful characters, the perfume trilogy has been created together with the perfumer Jorge Lee. Just like the theme of these shadow plays, the main objective of NISHANE was to emphasize the contrasting interaction of the people that we can see in every single culture.\nHACIVAT is a tribute to elegance, competence, and love of art.\nZENNE is a tribute to beauty, self-confidence, and flirtation.\nKARAGOZ is a tribute to wittiness, straightforwardness and sincerity\u201d \u2014 press release of the brand.

Among the first perfume creations of the house of Givenchy stands the legendary scent of L'Interdit from 1957, dedicated to actress Audrey Hepburn as the most significant muse of this fashion designer.\u00a0 In 2018, its new, modern version called L'Interdit Givenchy comes out, developed by perfumers Dominique Ropion, Anne Flipo and Fanny Bal as a floral-woody composition. The perfume is built on the basis of contrast between a bouquet of white flowers (including jasmine, tuberose and orange blossom) and intense woody and earthy notes of patchouli and vetiver. The concept behind the creation is the \"thrill of the forbidden\" and the challenge of crossing the line. ACTIVE INGREDIENTS: \"A white floral exalted with a dark accord. The first resolutely underground flower.\nThe white notes - orange blossom, jasmin and tuberose - are interlaced with darker more mysterious notes of vetiver and patchouli.\nA generous intense brightness that isn\u2019t afraid of subversion.\nUnforgettable, intense, addictive and fearlessly elegant.

Chlo\u00e9 launches Nomade, the new pillar fragrance of its perfume collection. Unlike the 2008 Chlo\u00e9 Eau de Parfum pillar, created to present purity and naturalness, the new Nomade is here to evoke the bold, adventurous side of Chloe women. It was created from inspiration by freedom, surprises, desire for open spaces and empowerment. Givaudan perfumer Quentin Bisch created Nomade as a floral chypre composition, including notes of Mirabelle plum, freesia and oak moss. The aim was to make it less floral and more \"dirty\" than the Chlo\u00e9 Signature. Chlo\u00e9 Signature represents a modern take of the perfume classic - the reinterpretation of the rose, while the new composition deals with the theme of chypre. The shape of the bottle mimics one of the classic bags of the house - the Drew model. The face of the advertising campaign filmed by Fleur Fortun\u00e9 is actress Ariane Labed.

The cut-out shapes of the puppets sometimes include translucent color or other types of detailing. Various effects can be achieved by moving both the puppets and the light source. A talented puppeteer can make the figures appear to walk, dance, fight, nod and laugh.\nKARAGOZ (meaning \u201cblack eye\u201d in Turkish) and HACIVAT (shortened in time from \"Hac\u0131 \u0130vaz\" meaning \"\u0130vaz the Pilgrim\"), ZENNE (the common name of the generally beautiful and flirty women featuring in various plays) are the lead characters of the traditional Turkish shadow play, popularized during the Ottoman period and then spread to most nation states that comprised the Ottoman Empire and most prominently in Turkey and Greece.\nThe creative directors Mert G\u00fczel and Murat Katran dreamed of bringing the legend of Karagoz & Hacivat into the today\u2019s world. Under the inspiration of their playful characters, the perfume trilogy has been created together with the perfumer Jorge Lee. Just like the theme of these shadow plays, the main objective of NISHANE was to emphasize the contrasting interaction of the people that we can see in every single culture.\nHACIVAT is a tribute to elegance, competence, and love of art.\nZENNE is a tribute to beauty, self-confidence, and flirtation.\nKARAGOZ is a tribute to wittiness, straightforwardness and sincerity\u201d \u2014 press release of the brand.

Gucci Bloom: Debuting the First Fragrance by Alessandro Michele: \u201cI wanted a green fragrance, a courageous scent that transports you to a vastgarden filled with many flowers and plants, a bouquet of abundance. The garden is as beautiful as women are; colorful, wild, diverse, where there is everything. GucciBloom smells of this garden in order to travel to a place that is not there,\u201d Alessandro Michele. Flowering from the authentic spirit of the women Alessandro Michele champions is an attitude of freedom to be who you want to be. Mixed with the color, decoration and pattern of the creative director\u2019s design canon, the women he dresses are flourishing in a natural, expressive and individual way: they are in bloom. The first Gucci fragrance developed wholly under Alessandro Michele\u2019s creative vision encapsulates this modern philosophy that is the guiding vision for the House.\nGucci Bloom celebrates the authenticity, vitality and diversity of the women he designs for, and those that identify themselves in his vision. True to who they are, these young women experience life and its fruits, blooming into their real selves. They convey their personal point-of-view without conventional limitations. They live for memorable experiences, to create stories and connect and be inspired by the objects, culture and art they choose to be surrounded by. Architect of every element of the scent, Alessandro Michele has infused Gucci Bloom\u2019s idea of lushness, life and vigor in each fragrant note, the dreamy campaign and its unconventional design.\n\u00a0\nABOUT THE SCENT:\u00a0 Blended by master perfumer Alberto Morillas with direction from Alessandro Michele, the fragrance is created to unfold like its name. The creative director envisioned the scent as a thriving garden full of diverse types of flowers and the rich perfume it emits.\n\u00a0\nAuthenticity is woven through qualitative, highly-concentrated natural ingredients.\nNotes blossom out like a concentration of flowers, the unique expression of the new to the world ingredients, brings a new olfactory experience. Natural Tuberose absolute harvested from India is interlaced with natural Jasmine absolute. Jasmine bud extract, obtained through an exclusive method of co-extraction that blends a natural quality of jasmine and captive moleculesto impart a fresh green and petal scent on the skin. Gucci Bloom also features notes of another plant used in perfume-making for the first time, the Rangoon Creeper. Discovered in South India, the Rangoon Creeper embodies the new scent\u2019s concept and name, as it changes color from white, gradually darkens to pink then finally to red when it blooms. The vine\u2019s flowers are redolent with a slightly powdery feminine floral perfume. ABOUT THE DESIGN:\u00a0 An arbiter and seeker of beauty, Alessandro Michele ideated a flacon and packaging that encapsulates the fragrance\u2019s spirit dedicated to the diversity of women.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe bottle is not designed feminine to seduce men, but to keep company with the women who wear the perfume. Retro and tender because of its color, with clean, slender lines, and not crafted in transparent glass but in porcelain, a material that I love very much,\u201d he said.\n\u00a0\nA vintage powder pink shades the lacquered porcelain square-shaped bottle, appliqu\u00e9d with the Gucci label ribbed and framed in black. The outer carton is covered inside and outside in Herbarium, a red-and-white toile de Jouy House print of leaves, cherry branches and flowers framed in black.\n\u00a0 ABOUT CAMPAIGN:\u00a0 Encapsulating the very meaning of Gucci Bloom, the campaign\u2019s idea is revealed through the contemporary women of Gucci: actress Dakota Johnson, actress and model Hari Nef and artist Petra Collins. Friends of Alessandro Michele, they have a special connection with the House, their talent resonating with Gucci\u2019s new vision. Their diverse individual beauty is shot by Glen Luchford, allowing them to radiate in the campaign\u2019s transformative setting. They wear Gucci Bloom during their day in the city, and it changes the surrounding urbanity into an imaginary stroll in a fantastical English garden. Tea on a sidewalk flourishing with blooms, walking in an apartment overgrown with verdant plants, and swimming at dusk in a lake entangled with shimmering flowers and reeds.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\nDancing, strolling, rejoicing in being free and full of life: this trio embody Gucci\u2019s new vitality and the captivating, transporting nature of Gucci Bloom.\n\u00a0 The fragrance will be available as a 30, 50 and 100 ml Eau de Parfum.

The new chapter of the modern fragrance history of the house of Rochas started with Secret de Rochas fragrance in 2013, almost 70 years after the introduction of the first perfume of this house.

Secret de Rochas Oud Myst\u00e8re was launched in 2014, and in 2015 we have a new edition called Secret de Rochas Rose Intense.\n\nAccording to Jean-Michel Duriez, Secret de Rochas Rose Intense highlights sensuality of a woman and offers new insight into her indefinable allure, inspired by Parisian joie de vivre and audacity. \"I wanted to create a boudoir atmosphere for this fragrance. A woman\u2019s boudoir is the one private room that is all her own, a place where she keeps all her secrets \u2013 fragrance, beauty and otherwise.

The flower is a little bit fragile, but the elegant and delicate scent is unique in the world of perfumery\u201d, said the perfumer. It is mixed with fruity accords of passion fruit and peach on the top. Red rose, rose leaf, osmanthus and secret ingredient form the heart of the perfume. Amber, moss, patchouli and musk notes end up in the base.\n\nSecret de Rochas Rose Intense shares the distinctive packaging of the original. While the keyhole-shaped bottle remains the same, the round, hand-made coffret, is given a rose hue evoking the vibrant shade of the rose de Mai. The juice is an intense rose color as well. \nThe fragrance is available as 100 ml Eau de Parfum.

Jasmin et Cigarette was launched in 2006. The nose behind this fragrance is Antoine Maisondieu. It is the era of Harcourt Studios when Greta Garbo and Marlene Dietrich magnetised men with a Hollywood look in the eye, smoking a cigarette in a smoky black and white ambiance. Jasmin et Cigarette is also the slightly jasminy smell of a woman\u2019s skin when she exposes her freshness to the dark seduction of night. A hazy atmosphere. The reminder of a fantasy, of an indelible trail she leaves on a dress at the break of day or in the intimate memory of the man who made love to her. It is elegance seen by Gainsbourg, the woman from the 80\u2019s who smokes Gitane cigarettes and wears jeans and who, with astounding naturalness, claims her sensuality as a right. Transparency in sophistication, just a trace of jasmine mingled to the so far neglected smell of a cigarette. Jasmin et Cigarette is the twilight zone, the banned, addiction. Nicotine woman or heroine, she is an icon, the woman one longs for.\n\nComposition: Jasmine asbolute, tobacco notes, apricot, tonka beans, curcuma, cedar, amber, musc...Nose for this perfume is Antoine Maisondieu.

This is a new fragrance. M\u00e9moire d\u2019une Odeur was launched in 2019. The nose behind this fragrance is Alberto Morillas. Top notes are Chamomile and Bitter Almond; middle notes are Musk, Indian Jasmine and Jasmine; base notes are Sandalwood, Cedar and Vanilla. \u201cEverything comes from my obsession with scents: my memory is primarily olfactive so, for me, my sense of smell is my memory. I thought that, deep down, perfume is that thing that even with your eyes closed, brings you to a precise moment in space and time. When we began to work on Gucci M\u00e9moire d\u2019une Odeur, I tried to imagine the recollection of a scent that couldn\u2019t easily be identified; a hybrid scent that resembles memory as much as possible,\u201d Alessandro Michele.\nScent is in our subconscious, attached to fragments of moments lived, coloring them with emotions of all-consuming joy, of intense love, or overwhelming sadness. A scent can gift a moment again, so an experience from the past can be relived in the now.\nFor a new Gucci fragrance story, scent becomes an explorer of the power of memories, bringing them back from the past and making them live in our present. Skipping backward and forward in chronological time, the present and past are connected by a unique bridge that projects directly into the future. Presenting a new universal Gucci scent. A perfume unassigned with a gender or a time. Presenting Gucci M\u00e9moire d\u2019une Odeur.\nGucci M\u00e9moire d\u2019une Odeur is an elixir that transcends gender by its individuality, to establish a new olfactive family, Mineral Aromatic. The transcendent accord features unexpected and enigmatic ingredients, and is defined by a note of Roman chamomile. Alessandro Michele envisioned this particular flower inside the scent, blended by master perfumer Alberto Morillas.\nGucci M\u00e9moire d\u2019une Odeur\u2019s Roman chamomile is structured with Indian Coral Jasmine petals for tenderness, precious musks for depth, and noble woods including warm, luminous sandalwood and airy, subtle cedarwood, a powerful tree with deep roots and an irresistible vanilla note.\nDisrupting the traditional olfactive families that classifies fragrances, Gucci M\u00e9moire d\u2019une Odeur establishes a new modern fragrance category, Mineral, which is a mix of scents and emotions: airy, musky, transparent and authentic. Mineral was classically used to describe facets of some fragrances, and combined with Aromatic, it becomes the center of Gucci Memoire d\u2019une Odeur.\n\u201dThe musky mineral accord is the keystone of the fragrance: it links all the other olfactive elements together with pure softness,\u201d Alberto Morillas.\n\u201cI had to think quite carefully about why Alessandro chose chamomile. When I started to work with the scent of chamomile itself, then I understood,\u201d Morillas said. \u201cNo one had done it before. Chamomile is known all over the world. Everyone has smelt it at some point, but as a dream, a memory of childhood, something timeless, and never in a fragrance. This flower is much underestimated and is a plant with an exceptional olfactive signature.\u201d\nRoman Chamomile has grown around Rome in terraced gardens since the 16th and 17th centuries. Giving a green aromatic scent, the sunny and hardy flower has an unparalleled character, radiating with joy to a sweet aromatic dry down with honey and green apple.\nIndian Coral Jasmine Nature Print \u00ae : A note exclusive to Gucci, collected in India, the star-shaped flower emits a more powerful scent and colors at night, remaining lighter and fresher during the day. Referred to as Queen of the Night, the official flower of Bengal, this unique quality of jasmine has a honeyed temper and an orangey coral-colored heart.\nGucci M\u00e9moire d\u2019une Odeur\u2019s dry down is an evanescent cloud, evolving on skin with a rhythm of Musks and iconic woods: Cedarwood and Sandalwood. The woody architecture of the fragrance brings intensity to its structure.\nAlessandro Michele discovered a vintage Gucci fragrance bottle, and was inspired by its design for Gucci M\u00e9moire d\u2019une Odeur\u2019s bottle. Grooved like a column from an ancient world, the bottle casts a refined silhouette in heavy transparent light green glass, crowned with shiny gold cap. Printed gold foil frames the label, revealing the Gucci logo together with the name of the fragrance.\n\u201cThe packaging comes from the past, inspired by an old Gucci perfume from the early 90s. I didn\u2019t want the bottle to take on a shape or size that is too feminine or too masculine because the perfume could be very much for women or very much for men,\u201d Alessandro Michele.\nSymbolizing a starry night sky and the earthly world that gazes up at it in marvel, the perfume\u2019s green box is decorated with Celestial firmaments inspired by the paintings of Roman and gothic churches of the Middle Ages and Renaissance in Europe. This particular pattern recalls Giotto\u2019s frescoes in the Scrovegni Chapel in Padova.\n\u201cThe guiding element of the entire campaign is the idea of freedom; the idea of the non-era, the non-place, the non-social. I pictured a world that was a fresco of a \u2018mythological\u2019 life in which the family is a private community with its own social framework where total freedom of expression prevails and where the roles of people and things aren\u2019t clear. I pictured the memory of an authentic memory,\u201d Alessandro Michele.\nA gathering of a free-spirited family, who embrace life by living freely and making memories together, an idea by Alessandro Michele. In diverse settings on the outskirts of Rome, the family are captured dancing, picnicking at sun kissed ruins of Canale Monterano, and in and around their family home, Montecalvello Castle\u2014a medieval castle featuring a fountain in a courtyard, and enigmatic frescoes inside and out. Director of the campaign Glen Luchford imbues the video and images with vibrant nostalgia, under the artistic direction of Christopher Simmonds. The print advertising campaign is composed like intimate photo albums, that show each member\u2019s character and their intimate rapport with one another.\nSinger, songwriter and actor Harry Styles leads the cast of the family, which includes an eclectic and universal mix of talents and models: Zumi Rosow (designer and musician), Ariana Papademetropoulos (artist), Stanislas Klossowski de Rola (actor and musician), Olimpia Dior (artist), Leslie Winer (model and musician), Thomas Riguelle (model), Tex Santos-Shaw (model), Tessa Bruinsma (model), Olga Zapivokhina (model), Oleg Ulrich (model), Mat\u00efss Rucko (model), Mae Lapres (model), William Valente (model), Katea Gramma (model), Unia Pakhomova (model), Ellia Sophia (model), Elibeidy Dani Martinez (model), Cheikh Tall (model), and Aaron Sirainen (model). The fragrance is available from August 1st 2019 as a 40m, 60ml and 100ml Eau de Parfum, and as a 30ml rollerball bottle.
