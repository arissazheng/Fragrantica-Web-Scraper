The new Dior Homme is created by Dior in-house perfumer Francois Demachy who wanted to redefine masculine sensuality. The fragrance is intensely woody, warm, and sensual. A virile accord of Atlas cedar and the warmth of cashmere wood are pampered with spicy aromas.\u00a0 \"This new Dior Homme has an unmistakably virile signature that does not prevent it from developing tender, sensual accents. It basically draws the portrait of a modern man.\" Fran\u00e7ois Demachy, Dior Perfumer-Creator According to the perfumer, this is a fragrance overdosed with carnal woody notes, and it represents a return to the basics: classic and simplicity. It is clear, clean, gentle, and woody but also slightly sweet, and wears like a second skin. The new bottle follows the architectural design of its predecessors, with a more prominent logo and perfume name on the plug. The face of the advertising campaign remains actor Robert Pattinson. Dior Homme is available as a 50 and 100 ml Eau de Toilette with the accompanying grooming line, now available in new packaging.
