This perfume is the winner of award FiFi Award Hall Of Fame 2005.This famous perfume was made by Andre Fraysse for Lavine home in 1927. The name was chosen by the daughter of the perfumer. Since she had been involved into music she chose name \u201cArpege\u201d, i.e. music term arpeggio. The original 1927 formula incredibly corresponded to its musical term - the notes of perfume play their theme alternately. In 1993, the perfume was reconstructed and that was a successful work. The composition was mostly well preserved, but still that was second great perfume. Top notes are: bergamot, aldehide, peach, orange bloom, honeysuckle, orris. In the heart there are: rose, jasmine, ylang-ylang, coriander, sensitive plant, tuberose, violet, and geranium. The base consists of: sandal, vetiver, patchoulis, vanilla and musk.\nThe bottle is lovely, too. The beautiful figures on the black misted background representing mother and daughter (wife and daughter of the perfumer), who are getting ready for the ball.\nIn October 2009 the house of Lanvin presents Arpege 120, their popular fragrance created back in 1927, reformed in 1993. The fragrance is composed of such notes as aldehydes, peach, bergamot, orange blossom, honeysuckle, iris, rose, jasmine, ylang-ylang, coriander, mimosa, tuberose, geranium, sandalwood, vetiver, patchouli, vanilla and musk.\nNew package is work of art director of the house of Lanvin - Alber Elbaz, whose main theme was mother-daughter relation, i.e. sketches of Jean Lanvin and her daughter Margaret, dressed in gorgeous violet dresses created in Parisian style. Lanvin celebrates 120 years of the house with sketched black flacon with golden details and pink hearts around mother and daughter.\nThe new flacon of Arpege 120 has been available in two amounts, 50 and 100 ml, since October 2009.

This perfume is the winner of award FiFi Award Hall Of Fame 2005.This famous perfume was made by Andre Fraysse for Lavine home in 1927. The name was chosen by the daughter of the perfumer. Since she had been involved into music she chose name \u201cArpege\u201d, i.e. music term arpeggio. The original 1927 formula incredibly corresponded to its musical term - the notes of perfume play their theme alternately. In 1993, the perfume was reconstructed and that was a successful work. The composition was mostly well preserved, but still that was second great perfume. Top notes are: bergamot, aldehide, peach, orange bloom, honeysuckle, orris. In the heart there are: rose, jasmine, ylang-ylang, coriander, sensitive plant, tuberose, violet, and geranium. The base consists of: sandal, vetiver, patchoulis, vanilla and musk.\nThe bottle is lovely, too. The beautiful figures on the black misted background representing mother and daughter (wife and daughter of the perfumer), who are getting ready for the ball.\nIn October 2009 the house of Lanvin presents Arpege 120, their popular fragrance created back in 1927, reformed in 1993. The fragrance is composed of such notes as aldehydes, peach, bergamot, orange blossom, honeysuckle, iris, rose, jasmine, ylang-ylang, coriander, mimosa, tuberose, geranium, sandalwood, vetiver, patchouli, vanilla and musk.\nNew package is work of art director of the house of Lanvin - Alber Elbaz, whose main theme was mother-daughter relation, i.e. sketches of Jean Lanvin and her daughter Margaret, dressed in gorgeous violet dresses created in Parisian style. Lanvin celebrates 120 years of the house with sketched black flacon with golden details and pink hearts around mother and daughter.\nThe new flacon of Arpege 120 has been available in two amounts, 50 and 100 ml, since October 2009.

Bois des Iles was launched in 1926. The nose behind this fragrance is Ernest Beaux. Top notes are Aldehydes, Coriander, Neroli, Peach, Bergamot and Mandarin Orange; middle notes are Ylang-Ylang, iris, Orris Root, Jasmine, Rose, Lilac and Lily-of-the-Valley; base notes are Sandalwood, Amber, Benzoin, Tonka Bean, Opoponax, Vanilla, Vetiver and Musk. The smell of autumn, forest, odor of great and dark woods... Bois des Iles, or the Island Forests, was created in 1926 by Ernest Beaux, the Russian emigrant and the prime perfumer of the Chanel house. It is said that Beaux created Bois des Iles while he was rapt by Tchaikovsky\\'s Queen of Spades, the opera inspired by the Puskin\\'s novel about the love and hazard, and that it was his favorite creation.\nTraditional masculine woody composition is offered to ladies, but could be tried by men as well. Dry and spicy freshness leads to the floral heart, the light sweetness of which undulates with dry and dark woody notes. At the end, the composition becomes warmer, more comfortable and tame, as if entering into a dark room illuminated by the fireplace flame.\nThe perfume concentration is richer and sweeter, while eau de toilette is quite lighter, but magnificent. The top notes are composed of aldehydes, bergamot, neroli and peach, the heart composition consists of jasmine, rose, lily of the valley, woody iris and ylang-ylang, and the base of vetiver, sandalwood, benzoin and musk.

This perfume is the winner of award FiFi Award Hall Of Fame 2005.This famous perfume was made by Andre Fraysse for Lavine home in 1927. The name was chosen by the daughter of the perfumer. Since she had been involved into music she chose name \u201cArpege\u201d, i.e. music term arpeggio. The original 1927 formula incredibly corresponded to its musical term - the notes of perfume play their theme alternately. In 1993, the perfume was reconstructed and that was a successful work. The composition was mostly well preserved, but still that was second great perfume. Top notes are: bergamot, aldehide, peach, orange bloom, honeysuckle, orris. In the heart there are: rose, jasmine, ylang-ylang, coriander, sensitive plant, tuberose, violet, and geranium. The base consists of: sandal, vetiver, patchoulis, vanilla and musk.\nThe bottle is lovely, too. The beautiful figures on the black misted background representing mother and daughter (wife and daughter of the perfumer), who are getting ready for the ball.\nIn October 2009 the house of Lanvin presents Arpege 120, their popular fragrance created back in 1927, reformed in 1993. The fragrance is composed of such notes as aldehydes, peach, bergamot, orange blossom, honeysuckle, iris, rose, jasmine, ylang-ylang, coriander, mimosa, tuberose, geranium, sandalwood, vetiver, patchouli, vanilla and musk.\nNew package is work of art director of the house of Lanvin - Alber Elbaz, whose main theme was mother-daughter relation, i.e. sketches of Jean Lanvin and her daughter Margaret, dressed in gorgeous violet dresses created in Parisian style. Lanvin celebrates 120 years of the house with sketched black flacon with golden details and pink hearts around mother and daughter.\nThe new flacon of Arpege 120 has been available in two amounts, 50 and 100 ml, since October 2009.

The smell of autumn, forest, odor of great and dark woods... Bois des Iles, or the Island Forests, was created in 1926 by Ernest Beaux, the Russian emigrant and the prime perfumer of the Chanel house. It is said that Beaux created Bois des Iles while he was rapt by Tchaikovsky\\'s Queen of Spades, the opera inspired by the Puskin\\'s novel about the love and hazard, and that it was his favorite creation.\nTraditional masculine woody composition is offered to ladies, but could be tried by men as well. Dry and spicy freshness leads to the floral heart, the light sweetness of which undulates with dry and dark woody notes. At the end, the composition becomes warmer, more comfortable and tame, as if entering into a dark room illuminated by the fireplace flame.\nThe perfume concentration is richer and sweeter, while eau de toilette is quite lighter, but magnificent. The top notes are composed of aldehydes, bergamot, neroli and peach, the heart composition consists of jasmine, rose, lily of the valley, woody iris and ylang-ylang, and the base of vetiver, sandalwood, benzoin and musk.

This perfume is the winner of award FiFi Award Hall Of Fame 2005.This famous perfume was made by Andre Fraysse for Lavine home in 1927. The name was chosen by the daughter of the perfumer. Since she had been involved into music she chose name \u201cArpege\u201d, i.e. music term arpeggio. The original 1927 formula incredibly corresponded to its musical term - the notes of perfume play their theme alternately. In 1993, the perfume was reconstructed and that was a successful work. The composition was mostly well preserved, but still that was second great perfume. Top notes are: bergamot, aldehide, peach, orange bloom, honeysuckle, orris. In the heart there are: rose, jasmine, ylang-ylang, coriander, sensitive plant, tuberose, violet, and geranium. The base consists of: sandal, vetiver, patchoulis, vanilla and musk.\nThe bottle is lovely, too. The beautiful figures on the black misted background representing mother and daughter (wife and daughter of the perfumer), who are getting ready for the ball.\nIn October 2009 the house of Lanvin presents Arpege 120, their popular fragrance created back in 1927, reformed in 1993. The fragrance is composed of such notes as aldehydes, peach, bergamot, orange blossom, honeysuckle, iris, rose, jasmine, ylang-ylang, coriander, mimosa, tuberose, geranium, sandalwood, vetiver, patchouli, vanilla and musk.\nNew package is work of art director of the house of Lanvin - Alber Elbaz, whose main theme was mother-daughter relation, i.e. sketches of Jean Lanvin and her daughter Margaret, dressed in gorgeous violet dresses created in Parisian style. Lanvin celebrates 120 years of the house with sketched black flacon with golden details and pink hearts around mother and daughter.\nThe new flacon of Arpege 120 has been available in two amounts, 50 and 100 ml, since October 2009.

The smell of autumn, forest, odor of great and dark woods... Bois des Iles, or the Island Forests, was created in 1926 by Ernest Beaux, the Russian emigrant and the prime perfumer of the Chanel house. It is said that Beaux created Bois des Iles while he was rapt by Tchaikovsky\\'s Queen of Spades, the opera inspired by the Puskin\\'s novel about the love and hazard, and that it was his favorite creation.\nTraditional masculine woody composition is offered to ladies, but could be tried by men as well. Dry and spicy freshness leads to the floral heart, the light sweetness of which undulates with dry and dark woody notes.

This perfume is the winner of award FiFi Award Hall Of Fame 2005.This famous perfume was made by Andre Fraysse for Lavine home in 1927. The name was chosen by the daughter of the perfumer. Since she had been involved into music she chose name \u201cArpege\u201d, i.e. music term arpeggio. The original 1927 formula incredibly corresponded to its musical term - the notes of perfume play their theme alternately. In 1993, the perfume was reconstructed and that was a successful work. The composition was mostly well preserved, but still that was second great perfume. Top notes are: bergamot, aldehide, peach, orange bloom, honeysuckle, orris. In the heart there are: rose, jasmine, ylang-ylang, coriander, sensitive plant, tuberose, violet, and geranium. The base consists of: sandal, vetiver, patchoulis, vanilla and musk.\nThe bottle is lovely, too. The beautiful figures on the black misted background representing mother and daughter (wife and daughter of the perfumer), who are getting ready for the ball.\nIn October 2009 the house of Lanvin presents Arpege 120, their popular fragrance created back in 1927, reformed in 1993. The fragrance is composed of such notes as aldehydes, peach, bergamot, orange blossom, honeysuckle, iris, rose, jasmine, ylang-ylang, coriander, mimosa, tuberose, geranium, sandalwood, vetiver, patchouli, vanilla and musk.\nNew package is work of art director of the house of Lanvin - Alber Elbaz, whose main theme was mother-daughter relation, i.e. sketches of Jean Lanvin and her daughter Margaret, dressed in gorgeous violet dresses created in Parisian style. Lanvin celebrates 120 years of the house with sketched black flacon with golden details and pink hearts around mother and daughter.\nThe new flacon of Arpege 120 has been available in two amounts, 50 and 100 ml, since October 2009.

Dry and spicy freshness leads to the floral heart, the light sweetness of which undulates with dry and dark woody notes. At the end, the composition becomes warmer, more comfortable and tame, as if entering into a dark room illuminated by the fireplace flame.\nThe perfume concentration is richer and sweeter, while eau de toilette is quite lighter, but magnificent. The top notes are composed of aldehydes, bergamot, neroli and peach, the heart composition consists of jasmine, rose, lily of the valley, woody iris and ylang-ylang, and the base of vetiver, sandalwood, benzoin and musk.

This perfume is the winner of award FiFi Award Hall Of Fame 2005.This famous perfume was made by Andre Fraysse for Lavine home in 1927. The name was chosen by the daughter of the perfumer. Since she had been involved into music she chose name \u201cArpege\u201d, i.e. music term arpeggio. The original 1927 formula incredibly corresponded to its musical term - the notes of perfume play their theme alternately. In 1993, the perfume was reconstructed and that was a successful work. The composition was mostly well preserved, but still that was second great perfume. Top notes are: bergamot, aldehide, peach, orange bloom, honeysuckle, orris. In the heart there are: rose, jasmine, ylang-ylang, coriander, sensitive plant, tuberose, violet, and geranium. The base consists of: sandal, vetiver, patchoulis, vanilla and musk.\nThe bottle is lovely, too. The beautiful figures on the black misted background representing mother and daughter (wife and daughter of the perfumer), who are getting ready for the ball.\nIn October 2009 the house of Lanvin presents Arpege 120, their popular fragrance created back in 1927, reformed in 1993.

The creators of Alien based the composition on three main lines: warm, white amber in the base, woodsy notes in the heart, and sunny Indian jasmine in the top.

The smell of autumn, forest, odor of great and dark woods... Bois des Iles, or the Island Forests, was created in 1926 by Ernest Beaux, the Russian emigrant and the prime perfumer of the Chanel house. It is said that Beaux created Bois des Iles while he was rapt by Tchaikovsky\\'s Queen of Spades, the opera inspired by the Puskin\\'s novel about the love and hazard, and that it was his favorite creation.\nTraditional masculine woody composition is offered to ladies, but could be tried by men as well. Dry and spicy freshness leads to the floral heart, the light sweetness of which undulates with dry and dark woody notes. At the end, the composition becomes warmer, more comfortable and tame, as if entering into a dark room illuminated by the fireplace flame.\nThe perfume concentration is richer and sweeter, while eau de toilette is quite lighter, but magnificent. The top notes are composed of aldehydes, bergamot, neroli and peach, the heart composition consists of jasmine, rose, lily of the valley, woody iris and ylang-ylang, and the base of vetiver, sandalwood, benzoin and musk.

This perfume is the winner of award FiFi Award Hall Of Fame 2005.This famous perfume was made by Andre Fraysse for Lavine home in 1927. The name was chosen by the daughter of the perfumer. Since she had been involved into music she chose name \u201cArpege\u201d, i.e. music term arpeggio. The original 1927 formula incredibly corresponded to its musical term - the notes of perfume play their theme alternately. In 1993, the perfume was reconstructed and that was a successful work. The composition was mostly well preserved, but still that was second great perfume. Top notes are: bergamot, aldehide, peach, orange bloom, honeysuckle, orris. In the heart there are: rose, jasmine, ylang-ylang, coriander, sensitive plant, tuberose, violet, and geranium. The base consists of: sandal, vetiver, patchoulis, vanilla and musk.\nThe bottle is lovely, too. The beautiful figures on the black misted background representing mother and daughter (wife and daughter of the perfumer), who are getting ready for the ball.\nIn October 2009 the house of Lanvin presents Arpege 120, their popular fragrance created back in 1927, reformed in 1993. The fragrance is composed of such notes as aldehydes, peach, bergamot, orange blossom, honeysuckle, iris, rose, jasmine, ylang-ylang, coriander, mimosa, tuberose, geranium, sandalwood, vetiver, patchouli, vanilla and musk.\nNew package is work of art director of the house of Lanvin - Alber Elbaz, whose main theme was mother-daughter relation, i.e. sketches of Jean Lanvin and her daughter Margaret, dressed in gorgeous violet dresses created in Parisian style. Lanvin celebrates 120 years of the house with sketched black flacon with golden details and pink hearts around mother and daughter.\nThe new flacon of Arpege 120 has been available in two amounts, 50 and 100 ml, since October 2009.

The smell of autumn, forest, odor of great and dark woods... Bois des Iles, or the Island Forests, was created in 1926 by Ernest Beaux, the Russian emigrant and the prime perfumer of the Chanel house. It is said that Beaux created Bois des Iles while he was rapt by Tchaikovsky\\'s Queen of Spades, the opera inspired by the Puskin\\'s novel about the love and hazard, and that it was his favorite creation.\nTraditional masculine woody composition is offered to ladies, but could be tried by men as well. Dry and spicy freshness leads to the floral heart, the light sweetness of which undulates with dry and dark woody notes. At the end, the composition becomes warmer, more comfortable and tame, as if entering into a dark room illuminated by the fireplace flame.\nThe perfume concentration is richer and sweeter, while eau de toilette is quite lighter, but magnificent. The top notes are composed of aldehydes, bergamot, neroli and peach, the heart composition consists of jasmine, rose, lily of the valley, woody iris and ylang-ylang, and the base of vetiver, sandalwood, benzoin and musk.

Arpege was launched in 1927. Arpege was created by Paul Vacher and Andre Fraysse. Top notes are Aldehydes, Lily-of-the-Valley, Honeysuckle, Peach, Neroli and Bergamot; middle notes are Jasmine, Ylang-Ylang, iris, Lily-of-the-Valley, Coriander, Rose, Lily, Geranium and Camellia; base notes are Sandalwood, Amber, Vetiver, Musk, Benzoin, Vanilla and Patchouli. This perfume is the winner of award FiFi Award Hall Of Fame 2005.This famous perfume was made by Andre Fraysse for Lavine home in 1927. The name was chosen by the daughter of the perfumer. Since she had been involved into music she chose name \u201cArpege\u201d, i.e. music term arpeggio. The original 1927 formula incredibly corresponded to its musical term - the notes of perfume play their theme alternately. In 1993, the perfume was reconstructed and that was a successful work. The composition was mostly well preserved, but still that was second great perfume. Top notes are: bergamot, aldehide, peach, orange bloom, honeysuckle, orris. In the heart there are: rose, jasmine, ylang-ylang, coriander, sensitive plant, tuberose, violet, and geranium. The base consists of: sandal, vetiver, patchoulis, vanilla and musk.\nThe bottle is lovely, too. The beautiful figures on the black misted background representing mother and daughter (wife and daughter of the perfumer), who are getting ready for the ball.\nIn October 2009 the house of Lanvin presents Arpege 120, their popular fragrance created back in 1927, reformed in 1993. The fragrance is composed of such notes as aldehydes, peach, bergamot, orange blossom, honeysuckle, iris, rose, jasmine, ylang-ylang, coriander, mimosa, tuberose, geranium, sandalwood, vetiver, patchouli, vanilla and musk.\nNew package is work of art director of the house of Lanvin - Alber Elbaz, whose main theme was mother-daughter relation, i.e. sketches of Jean Lanvin and her daughter Margaret, dressed in gorgeous violet dresses created in Parisian style. Lanvin celebrates 120 years of the house with sketched black flacon with golden details and pink hearts around mother and daughter.\nThe new flacon of Arpege 120 has been available in two amounts, 50 and 100 ml, since October 2009.

Diorissimo is a romantic fragrance of the 50\u2019s. At its heart, a gentle lily of the valley, blooms as Dior\u2019s favorite \u201cfortune\u201d flower. Diorissimo is fresh and clear, just like a dewy, spring morning in the woods. Top notes include lily-of-the- valley and ylang-ylang, the heart is composed of amaryllis and boronia, leaving a jasmine trail.\nChristian Dior believed that lily-of-the valley is the symbol of hope, happiness and joy. French consider lily of the valley as the legendary flower. According to the legend a brave and fearless fighter, called Saint Leonard wanted, to spend his days among the flowers and trees and live a life dedicated to God. He asked permission to go live in the woods. A dragon called Temptetaion lived in those woods. They fought and blood was spilled. Leonard bravely fought the dragon until it was defeated. Poisonous weeds began to grow where the dragon spilled his blood, but beds of lilies of the valley started to grom wherever the ground was moistened with Saint Leonard's. The French believe that lily-of-the valley is a holy flower and so did Christian Dior whichinspired the creation of this wonderful fragrance.\nThe creator from Grasse, France, Edmond Roudnitska, wanted to create a perfume that would be revolutionary and break the trend of sweet perfumes that were dominating the market. The goal was to simplifie perfume\u2019s formula and create a perfume that\u2019s simple and luminous. He dreamed of perfume similar to that of muguet that enveloped his senses when he was resting in his garden. Dior and Roudnitska met in 1955 and made their dream come true in 1956- Diorissimo was created!The perfume was represented by an illustration by Ren\u00e9 Gruau.According to Christian Dior, Diorissimo is the perfume of his spirit, or, \"the scented expression of his soul\".

It is said that Beaux created Bois des Iles while he was rapt by Tchaikovsky\\'s Queen of Spades, the opera inspired by the Puskin\\'s novel about the love and hazard, and that it was his favorite creation.\nTraditional masculine woody composition is offered to ladies, but could be tried by men as well. Dry and spicy freshness leads to the floral heart, the light sweetness of which undulates with dry and dark woody notes. At the end, the composition becomes warmer, more comfortable and tame, as if entering into a dark room illuminated by the fireplace flame.\nThe perfume concentration is richer and sweeter, while eau de toilette is quite lighter, but magnificent. The top notes are composed of aldehydes, bergamot, neroli and peach, the heart composition consists of jasmine, rose, lily of the valley, woody iris and ylang-ylang, and the base of vetiver, sandalwood, benzoin and musk.

This perfume is the winner of award FiFi Award Hall Of Fame 2005.This famous perfume was made by Andre Fraysse for Lavine home in 1927. The name was chosen by the daughter of the perfumer. Since she had been involved into music she chose name \u201cArpege\u201d, i.e. music term arpeggio. The original 1927 formula incredibly corresponded to its musical term - the notes of perfume play their theme alternately. In 1993, the perfume was reconstructed and that was a successful work. The composition was mostly well preserved, but still that was second great perfume. Top notes are: bergamot, aldehide, peach, orange bloom, honeysuckle, orris. In the heart there are: rose, jasmine, ylang-ylang, coriander, sensitive plant, tuberose, violet, and geranium. The base consists of: sandal, vetiver, patchoulis, vanilla and musk.\nThe bottle is lovely, too. The beautiful figures on the black misted background representing mother and daughter (wife and daughter of the perfumer), who are getting ready for the ball.\nIn October 2009 the house of Lanvin presents Arpege 120, their popular fragrance created back in 1927, reformed in 1993.

The creators of Alien based the composition on three main lines: warm, white amber in the base, woodsy notes in the heart, and sunny Indian jasmine in the top.

Diorissimo is a romantic fragrance of the 50\u2019s. At its heart, a gentle lily of the valley, blooms as Dior\u2019s favorite \u201cfortune\u201d flower. Diorissimo is fresh and clear, just like a dewy, spring morning in the woods. Top notes include lily-of-the- valley and ylang-ylang, the heart is composed of amaryllis and boronia, leaving a jasmine trail.\nChristian Dior believed that lily-of-the valley is the symbol of hope, happiness and joy. French consider lily of the valley as the legendary flower. According to the legend a brave and fearless fighter, called Saint Leonard wanted, to spend his days among the flowers and trees and live a life dedicated to God. He asked permission to go live in the woods. A dragon called Temptetaion lived in those woods. They fought and blood was spilled. Leonard bravely fought the dragon until it was defeated. Poisonous weeds began to grow where the dragon spilled his blood, but beds of lilies of the valley started to grom wherever the ground was moistened with Saint Leonard's. The French believe that lily-of-the valley is a holy flower and so did Christian Dior whichinspired the creation of this wonderful fragrance.\nThe creator from Grasse, France, Edmond Roudnitska, wanted to create a perfume that would be revolutionary and break the trend of sweet perfumes that were dominating the market. The goal was to simplifie perfume\u2019s formula and create a perfume that\u2019s simple and luminous. He dreamed of perfume similar to that of muguet that enveloped his senses when he was resting in his garden. Dior and Roudnitska met in 1955 and made their dream come true in 1956- Diorissimo was created!The perfume was represented by an illustration by Ren\u00e9 Gruau.According to Christian Dior, Diorissimo is the perfume of his spirit, or, \"the scented expression of his soul\".

Bois des Iles was launched in 1926. The nose behind this fragrance is Ernest Beaux. Top notes are Aldehydes, Coriander, Neroli, Peach, Bergamot and Mandarin Orange; middle notes are Ylang-Ylang, iris, Orris Root, Jasmine, Rose, Lilac and Lily-of-the-Valley; base notes are Sandalwood, Amber, Benzoin, Tonka Bean, Opoponax, Vanilla, Vetiver and Musk. The smell of autumn, forest, odor of great and dark woods... Bois des Iles, or the Island Forests, was created in 1926 by Ernest Beaux, the Russian emigrant and the prime perfumer of the Chanel house. It is said that Beaux created Bois des Iles while he was rapt by Tchaikovsky\\'s Queen of Spades, the opera inspired by the Puskin\\'s novel about the love and hazard, and that it was his favorite creation.\nTraditional masculine woody composition is offered to ladies, but could be tried by men as well. Dry and spicy freshness leads to the floral heart, the light sweetness of which undulates with dry and dark woody notes. At the end, the composition becomes warmer, more comfortable and tame, as if entering into a dark room illuminated by the fireplace flame.\nThe perfume concentration is richer and sweeter, while eau de toilette is quite lighter, but magnificent. The top notes are composed of aldehydes, bergamot, neroli and peach, the heart composition consists of jasmine, rose, lily of the valley, woody iris and ylang-ylang, and the base of vetiver, sandalwood, benzoin and musk.

This perfume is the winner of award FiFi Award Hall Of Fame 2005.This famous perfume was made by Andre Fraysse for Lavine home in 1927. The name was chosen by the daughter of the perfumer. Since she had been involved into music she chose name \u201cArpege\u201d, i.e. music term arpeggio. The original 1927 formula incredibly corresponded to its musical term - the notes of perfume play their theme alternately. In 1993, the perfume was reconstructed and that was a successful work. The composition was mostly well preserved, but still that was second great perfume. Top notes are: bergamot, aldehide, peach, orange bloom, honeysuckle, orris. In the heart there are: rose, jasmine, ylang-ylang, coriander, sensitive plant, tuberose, violet, and geranium. The base consists of: sandal, vetiver, patchoulis, vanilla and musk.\nThe bottle is lovely, too. The beautiful figures on the black misted background representing mother and daughter (wife and daughter of the perfumer), who are getting ready for the ball.\nIn October 2009 the house of Lanvin presents Arpege 120, their popular fragrance created back in 1927, reformed in 1993. The fragrance is composed of such notes as aldehydes, peach, bergamot, orange blossom, honeysuckle, iris, rose, jasmine, ylang-ylang, coriander, mimosa, tuberose, geranium, sandalwood, vetiver, patchouli, vanilla and musk.\nNew package is work of art director of the house of Lanvin - Alber Elbaz, whose main theme was mother-daughter relation, i.e. sketches of Jean Lanvin and her daughter Margaret, dressed in gorgeous violet dresses created in Parisian style. Lanvin celebrates 120 years of the house with sketched black flacon with golden details and pink hearts around mother and daughter.\nThe new flacon of Arpege 120 has been available in two amounts, 50 and 100 ml, since October 2009.

The creators of Alien based the composition on three main lines: warm, white amber in the base, woodsy notes in the heart, and sunny Indian jasmine in the top.

Diorissimo is a romantic fragrance of the 50\u2019s. At its heart, a gentle lily of the valley, blooms as Dior\u2019s favorite \u201cfortune\u201d flower. Diorissimo is fresh and clear, just like a dewy, spring morning in the woods. Top notes include lily-of-the- valley and ylang-ylang, the heart is composed of amaryllis and boronia, leaving a jasmine trail.\nChristian Dior believed that lily-of-the valley is the symbol of hope, happiness and joy. French consider lily of the valley as the legendary flower. According to the legend a brave and fearless fighter, called Saint Leonard wanted, to spend his days among the flowers and trees and live a life dedicated to God. He asked permission to go live in the woods. A dragon called Temptetaion lived in those woods. They fought and blood was spilled. Leonard bravely fought the dragon until it was defeated. Poisonous weeds began to grow where the dragon spilled his blood, but beds of lilies of the valley started to grom wherever the ground was moistened with Saint Leonard's. The French believe that lily-of-the valley is a holy flower and so did Christian Dior whichinspired the creation of this wonderful fragrance.\nThe creator from Grasse, France, Edmond Roudnitska, wanted to create a perfume that would be revolutionary and break the trend of sweet perfumes that were dominating the market. The goal was to simplifie perfume\u2019s formula and create a perfume that\u2019s simple and luminous. He dreamed of perfume similar to that of muguet that enveloped his senses when he was resting in his garden. Dior and Roudnitska met in 1955 and made their dream come true in 1956- Diorissimo was created!The perfume was represented by an illustration by Ren\u00e9 Gruau.According to Christian Dior, Diorissimo is the perfume of his spirit, or, \"the scented expression of his soul\".
