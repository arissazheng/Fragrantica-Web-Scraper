Top notes are Peony, Litchi and Freesia; middle notes are Rose, Lily-of-the-Valley and Magnolia; base notes are Virginia Cedar and Amber. The new eponymous eau de parfum by Chloe is quite a departure from the once-popular tuberose composition of the same name. A light and fresh yet seductively strong and self-possessed scent, the new Chloe fragrance is in no way its predecessor's timid younger sister. Just like all Chloe's bold, arty and free-spirited designs, the fragrance is feminine in a rather non-traditional, not all-out-girly way. Its accords expertly play against each other and they seduce the audience by being both elegant and daring at the same time. The fragrance is very versatile, it is intended for everyday use and is more than suitable for becoming someone's unique signature scent. Chloe edp was launched in 2008.

After presenting more than successful fragrance for women, The One, Dolce&Gabbana house launched a fragrance for men named The One for Men at the begining of March 2008.

The notes of this fragrance are composed in accordance with the Gabbana creator\\'s taste, who wanted to create a woody-oriental composition. In line with that Gabbana said:\"I like spicy-oriental notes and we\\'ve never done these types of fragrances, it\\'s a little warmer than our other men's scents\". Fragrance The One for Men opens with sparkling notes of bergamot, coriander and basil, the middle motes bring in cardamom, ginger and neroli, while the base notes create a very masculine trace of cedar, ambergris and tobacco. The fragrance is created in cooperation with P&G Prestige Product and International Flavors & Fragrances Inc. (IFF). It comes in a glass made bottle that matches the shape of The One for Women bottle, only with silver-metal neck and chocolate-brown rectangular top. The model of the fragrance advertising campaign will be the actor Matthew McConaughey, who will next week join the designers in the NYC. When it comes to the choice of the model, the Dolce&Gabbana designers said that they wanted to have the sexiest man on the planet. And with regards to that, Gabbana adds that this is the first time that a model in one of D&G men\\'s fragrance campaigns appears in clothes. The One for Men will be available in the US as EDT in two sizes \u2013 50ml and 100ml bottles. Besides EDT the collection will include 100ml aftershave lotion, 75ml aftershave balm, 200ml shower gel and 75ml deodorant stick.

Acqua di Gioia is a new fragrance by Giorgio Armani, presented in March 2010. Seductive sea aromas in the new fragrance are put into first plan and used as creators' inspiration. Composition of the perfume is compared with woman who is ''strong, dignified and free spirit but in perfect harmony with nature''.\nInspired by several summer holidays spent on the islands of Pantelleria and Antigua, where Armani has his villas, the fragrance was lead by the idea of escape into nature, a heavenly place of real holiday where we restore the energy necessary to body and soul, and where we create natural balance.\nIts flacon was made as a natural shape \u2013 water drops which are clear, airy, and pellucid.\nThe fragrance arrives on the market in June 2010 as a blend of refreshing notes of crushed mint leaves and lemon Limone Primo Fiore Femminello from Calabria. Structure of the composition pushes the limits from fresh citruses to a floral heart which encompasses aquatic jasmine, dewy peony and pink pepper, while a base closes with cedar, yellow sugar and labdanum. Acqua di Gioia was created by three perfumers: Loc Dong, Anne Flipo and Dominique Ropion, who see it as Eve's seduction and as fragrance turned completely towards the nature.\nThe perfume can be purchased as 30, 50 and 100 ml EDP, along with 200 ml body lotion.

Lady Million was launched in 2010. Lady Million was created by Anne Flipo, Beatrice Piquet, Dominique Ropion and Bruno Jovanovic. Top notes are Raspberry, Neroli and Amalfi Lemon; middle notes are Jasmine, African Orange flower and Gardenia; base notes are white honey, Patchouli and Amber. 1 Million is one of the most popular fragrances launched in last several years. After the edition for men, women's version inspired by gold and wealth was expected. Two years after men's edition, fragrant lady finally appears - Lady Million! We can just assume if this lady wants to earn millions or look like a million dollar. It is perfectly clear that the woman represented by this edition radiates, dominates and possesses fiery character with incredible sensuality.\nFlacon of Lady Million is in tune with composition and theme of this edition. Instead of gold bullion, the flacon for women is designed as a golden diamond. While insinuating luxury and wealth, the fragrance prepares a surprising composition of intertwined floral, fresh and woody accords. Only diamond can compete with gold, so Lady Million is the perfect companion to modern and masculine 1 Million.\n\nThe Notes of Fragrance\nAnne Flipo, B\u00e9atrice Piquet and Dominque Ropion have all created scents for some of the biggest names in perfumery. But what path did they take to create Lady Million? \u201cIt was clear that this perfume had to be as charismatic as 1 Million, with as strong a signature, yet without a direct olfactory link. The Lady Million woman is dazzling, always seductive. This \u2018playful\u2019 aspect inspired us immensely. Lady Million is fresh, floral and woody, like a nectar of voluptuous flowers, trailing delicately but still very present. Powerfully seductive, the sparkle of bitter orange with a touch of raspberry reveals the first breath. A burst of neroli follows, smooth and bright. But then the lethal weapon of heady orange blossom slips out of its sheath. Its narcotic sweetness bewitches and grabs all attention. Then, joining with Arabian jasmine underlined by gardenia, the blend soars into something more carnal, yet ever subtle. Now the obsessive pulsing of patchouli enters the fray, pacifying the honey with an addictive and terribly tempting sweetness. Amber spreads to become all enveloping, floating around the beauty, following each movement and offering its most beautiful facets\u201d.\n Designer of the attractive, luxurious flacon is Noe Duchaufour-Lawrance. The perfume will be available as 30, 50 and 80ml edp.\nWe can expect the fragrance on the market in July 2010. Lady Million makes men's fantasy and desires come true. Advertising face is Dree Hemingway.

Womanity was launched in 2010. Womanity was created by Mane, Alexis Dadier and Ralf Schwieger. 18 years after Angel and 5 years after extraordinary Alien, Thierry Mugler is saluting femininity. The new edition will thrill all fans of his creations. It is named Womanity and it arrives in stores in mid-June 2010. Thierry Mugler with Womanity plans to launch (for the third time) a bestseller perfume and which will attract the public for years. Womanity is a word created to connect femininity, humanity and city. An overture to this edition began in March 2010 when Mugler launched Womanity.com web site with an idea that every woman cooperates in its creation and finishing touch. With an aim to create contents for the website, one story is finished by several women, each of them writing on her page. Contest asks women to give creative ideas for a particular project or cause. The winner will work with Mugler to finish the website. Fragrance WOMANITY was created as a part of this phenomenon, in a pink bottle. Connections between women are presented as chains and ring on top of the bottle which is decorated with metal frieze with symbolic design. Design of the top part of the bottle and beautiful frieze figures can be interpreted as Gothic or Art Deco style. Mugler's idea was however that the frieze encapsulated and depicted women of all generations. Composition of Womanity was created by Mane, as a powerful contrast of elements. By using the new molecular process of extraction, Mane manages to extract natural aromas of fig for sweet accords. Savory notes originate from caviar and the structure in ensured by fig wood aromas. Pierre Aulas, olfactive director of Clarins Fragrance Group, says that it is a true challenge to work on Mugler's idea of combining savoury and sweet notes.

Jo Malone presents new fragrance, English Pear and Freesia, which unites English landscapes and seasons which are connected with souls of the British.\nInspiration for this fragrance were also verses by one of the last great romantic poets, John Keats (Ode to Autumn).\nJo Malone's creative studio chose a perfumer for this collection. That is Christine Nagel known for numerous successful creations (Miss Dior Cherie, Narciso Rodriguez, Rose Absolue, Delices etc). The fragrance is ripe, juicy and thoroughly designed.\nNuances of freesia and pear are very complex, since ripe pears were necessary to achieve a certain note to sound unique in composition of the fragrance.\nPear in the moment of perfect ripeness has crispy structure of skin and juicy fruit. Pear is combined with quince which introduces honey sweetness and is surrounded with white freesia and wild climbing rose.\nA base of the composition is created of green, fresh and sour nuances of rhubarb along with warm and subtle aromas of patchouli, amber and white musk that stay in a trail.\nJo Malone English Pear and Freesia is available as 30 and 100ml EDC. The fragrance arrives on the market in September 2010.

Her favorite scent is the scent of home, so she wanted a fragrance that will be a magical potion with that kind of smell. Mathilde Bijaoui created for her a composition of yellow tangerine, ginger, pumpkin, immortelle, Moroccan neroli, Grass rose, vetiver, heliotrope and musk.  It is available as 50 ml EDP. \"I have always located my favourite fragrances at the doorways of kitchens, in the heart of a greenhouse, at the bottom of a garden. Scent means place to me : place and state of mind - even state of grace. Certainly state of ease. My favourite smells are the smells of home, the experience of the reliable recognisable after the exotic adventure: the regular - natural - turn of the seasons, simplicity and softness after the duck and dive of definition in the wide, wide world.\n\nWhen Mathilde Bijaoui first asked me what my own favourite scent in a bottle might contain, I described a magic potion that I could carry with me wherever I went that would hold for me the fragrance - the spirit - of home. The warm ginger of new baking on a wood table, the immortelle of a fresh spring afternoon, the lazy sunshine of my grandfather's summer greenhouse, woodsmoke and the whisky peat of the Scottish Highlands after rain. I told her about a bottle of spirit, something very simple, to me : something almost indescribable, so personal it should be. The miracle is that Mathilde made it.\n\nThe great Sufi poet Rumi wrote :\n\nIf anyone wants to know what \"spirit\" is,\n\n\u2028or what \"God\u2019s fragrance\" means,\n\n\u2028lean your head toward him or her.\u2028\n\nKeep your face there close.\n\nLike this.\n\nThis is possibly my favourite poem of all time.\n\nIt restores me like the smoke/rain/gingerbread/ greenhouse my scent-sense is fed by. It is a poem about simplicity, about human-scaled miracles. About trust. About home.\n\nIn my fantasy there is a lost chapter of Alice in Wonderland - after the drink saying Drink Me, after the cake pleading Eat Me - where the adventuring, alien, Alice, way down the rabbit hole, far from the familiar and maybe somewhat homesick - comes upon a modest glass with a ginger stem reaching down into a pale golden scent that humbly suggests : Like This\u2026\"\n\nTilda Swinton\n\nComposition: Yellow tangerine, ginger, immortelle flower, Moroccan Neroli, Grasse rose, vetyver, heliotrope, musks...\" Read about this perfume in other languages: Deutsch, Espa\u00f1ol, Fran\u00e7ais, Italiano, \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439, Polski, Portugu\u00eas, \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac, \u6c49\u8bed, Nederlands, Srpski, Rom\u00e2n\u0103, \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629, \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430, \u041c\u043e\u043d\u0433\u043e\u043b, \u05e2\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05ea.", "top notes": [], "middle notes": ["Immortelle", "Pumpkin", "Ginger", "Tangerine", "Heliotrope", "Musk", "vetyver", "Neroli", "Rose"], "base notes": [], "longevity": {"very weak": 38, "weak": 49, "moderate": 140, "long lasting": 175, "eternal": 59}, "sillage": {"intimate": 155, "moderate": 293, "strong": 133, "enormous": 121}, "gender_vote": {"female": 11, "more female": 27, "unisex": 39, "more male": 3, "male": 0}, "price value": {"way overpriced": 1, "overpriced": 10, "ok": 38, "good value": 5, "great value": 1}}, {"name": "Flora by Gucci Eau de Parfum", "company": "Gucci", "image": "https://fimgs.net/mdimg/perfume/375x500.7610.jpg", "for_gender": "for women", "rating": 3.91, "number_votes": 2956, "main accords": {"floral": 100.0, "citrus": 81.5409, "fresh": 76.057, "rose": 66.9933, "fruity": 62.0201, "woody": 57.0354, "soft spicy": 50.7294, "patchouli": 44.7696, "warm spicy": 44.6542}, "description": "Flora by Gucci Eau de Parfum by Gucci is a Floral fragrance for women.

The brand Mont Blanc presents a new men's fragrance in April 2011. Legend is dedicated to inspiring, virtuous and self-confident men who are courageous, passionate and authentic. Their fragrance is subtle but striking and masculine. Olivier Pescheux, the perfumer behind this fresh fougere creation, tried to make the fragrance filled with contrasts, combining notes that evoke strength and tenderness, tradition and modernity. The composition opens with fresh aromatic tones of bergamot, lavender, pineapple leaf and exotic verbena (Litsea Cubeba). The heart emphasizes oakmoss note (evernyl molecule) merged with geranium, coumarin, apple, rose, and Pomarosa molecule (notes of dried fruit). The base contains sandalwood, tonka and evernyl. Heavy and slightly curved bottle of black and metallic colors is inspired by the famous Meisterst\u00fcck pen design, made of glass and metal.

Iris is the central ingredient of the fragrance, along with several \"new interesting musks\", found by the perfumer. Talking about iris, the perfumer pointed out it is a very demanding ingredient.
